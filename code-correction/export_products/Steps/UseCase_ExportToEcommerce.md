# Akeneo to Ecommerce integration

Akeneo's API is great to get the data you need over to your different channels.

Currently, your ecommerce platform can consume a CSV file to import products and other entities. 
Every night you have a cronjob launching an import of different CSV files to populate your Ecommerce with the latest updates of products, attributes, categories & families.
